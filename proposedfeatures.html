                <h2 class="feature-decr-heading">Features we are researching & experimenting on to be released in future!</h2>


                <p class="feature-intro-para"> These are features we are currently researching and experimenting with, and we plan to release them in the future. We are working hard to make sure these features are accurate, so we won't announce a release date just yet. Below are the topics we are focusing on:</p></br>


                <h2 class="first-feature-heading">1. Age Reversal Science</h2>

                <p class="first-feature-para">Peopleâ€™s age can be measured in two ways: Chronological Age and Biological Age.</br> &nbsp;ðŸŒŸ&nbsp; Chronological age is based on your birth-date (e.g., a person born in 2003 will be 21 years old in 2024).</br> &nbsp;ðŸŒŸ&nbsp; Biological age is based on how well your body is performing. For example, someone who is 34 years old chronologically but has the health of an 18-year-old could have a biological age of 18. This means they may live longer and stay healthier.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculating biological age is complex, often requiring a lot of data, and even then, the results can have some error. While some methods exist for estimating biological age with simple data, they may be either too complicated or not always reliable. We are working on improving these methods, relying on existing research and studies.</br> If you're interested in this topic without diving deep into the science, we recommend watching Bryan Johnsonâ€™s videos on YouTube.

                <!-- <h2 class="second-feature-heading">2. Adulthood Issues: Masturbation and Its Impact</h2>

                <p class="second-feature-para">We've noticed that masturbation has become more common among younger adults, and it is leading to both physiological and psychological problems. While this issue is often ignored or hidden, there is research worldwide showing its negative effects. However, changing cultural norms is not a solution. Instead, we're developing a system where users can input their data privately and receive guidance to improve their habits. The best part is that the data will not be shared with anyone by default, not even us. This feature will likely be available through our website or a mobile app in the future.</p> -->

    

                <h2 class="third-feature-heading">2. Connecting Fitness Trackers</h2>

                <p class="third-feature-para">We're exploring the possibility of connecting HealZenic accounts to fitness trackers (like smartwatches). Since fitness trackers have their own software, it might be challenging to collect the data we need, but if this becomes possible, it would allow us to track your health more accurately. This feature would be available to users with fitness trackers and provide more reliable health reports than using manually entered data.</p>
                </br>
                
                <h2 class="fourth-feature-heading">3. Sleep Time Analysis</h2>

                    <p class="fourth-feature-para">We are improving our sleep time analysis model. Research shows that the amount of sleep required varies for each individual and depends on several factors. Currently, our model uses standard sleep duration based on age groups, but this approach isnâ€™t very accurate. Our planned model will be more personalized and provide better insights tailored to each user.</p></br>
