## 📌 Note
This version of Healzenic was developed only to **demonstrate our idea and vision** of managing and improving human health in a **wise, smart, and simple way**.  
- Many features may not be functional.  
- This repo is **open-sourced** for reference.  

We are now working on a **new version – Healzenic v2.0** (closed-source), a complete product with all features (many newly introduced) fully working.  
The hackathon proved that our idea has **true potential**, and Healzenic 2.0 will take it to the next level.
